During this time, I got a chance to visit various domains and technologies, which helped shape how I think and work now.<br /><br />I like to create software and help other developers like me around. I have recently been interested in making more layman talks than the geeky (development intensive). I believe everyone attached to a concept should have a right to completely and concisely understand it.<br /><br />Some recent technologies I have been working on are NodeJS, React, Docker, Kubernetes, Electron, and others. My main focus is on problem-solving, irrespective of the platform.",

        "Consumed 100+ pages docs and created 8 different SDKs in 8 different languages",
        "Created world class documentation to use the SDK, instead of reading 100+ pages, usually just 10 lines of code",
        "Introduced semantic versioning within the SDKs so that change could be well contained and not disastourous",
        "Lead by example on raising PRs under various systems, so that developers are motivated to do so",
        "SDKs varied from being old-school (.NET 2.0) to bleeding edge (ReactNative, NodeJS); Same functionality throughout"
