# My Resume

> Everyone has a right to one, and this is mine :smile:

I found it amazing to maintain my resume over Github, which is versioned and easy to maintain. You can download multiple flavours of it visiting this [address](https://aajiwani.github.io/my-resume/) -- Don't worry the link is hoted on Github pages (safe to visit).
